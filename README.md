# Model Card for HermitCrab-Predict

This model was created as part of the BeCode AI Bootcamp over the course of approximately two weeks in March 2024. It is the third phase of the project, and utilizes the data previously acquired to create a model to predict the price of Houses and Apartments in Belgium.

# Uses

This model is specifically meant to be used to predict the pricing of properties in Belgium.

## Direct Use

The user can provide the model with certain pieces of data, and the model will attempt to give its best estimate on what the price of the house should be, based on said parameter values.

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

This model has been trained with only data from properties in the category of House and Apartment in Belgium. As such, properties outside of these two categories cannot have their prices be accurately predicted.

## Recommendations

To use only properties in Belgium, that are categorized as either House or Apartment.

# Training Details

## Training Data

The model was trained from a dataset with approximately 70,000 properties in Belgium, obtained by scraping immoweb.be (see Model Description for extra GitHub Repo resources).

## Training Procedure

### Preprocessing

The preprocessing starts with loading the .csv file. It will then append some missing data using external files,  convert some non-numerical values into numerical values as well as fill some empty values using logical reasoning and. Some extra cleaning is still done during the prediction, but this is done simply to get the correct parameters that we use in the model.

# Evaluation
